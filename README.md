EOS Transaction Spammer 
Why spam the network with transactions?
It speeds up confirmations!
EOS is a cryptocurrency whose transaction confirmations are based on subsequent transactions that get added to the tangle. So the more transactions that get added to the tangle, the faster previous transactions get confirmed.
There are other bottlenecks in play that may limit confirmation time, like network quality, bandwidth, and node reliability.
How does this work?
This webapp combines two libraries from the EOS foundation to work: EOS.lib.js for interacting with EOS nodes and curl.lib.js for doing the PoW (Proof of Work) in your web browser.
Could spamming be bad?
This tool was made with the intention of strengthening the EOS network. EOS is still very early in its development and will need to handle traffic orders of magnitude higher than the people spamming the network today, in order to succeed as a cryptocurrency in the future. This spamming acts as a test for the network that can be utilized to further improve the code, fix bugs and performance issues. In this sense, spamming this early on in this project is a very good thing.
